## Independent Projects & Open-Source Portfolio

All projects listed below were **solely conceived, directed, and built** by Cassandra Harrison.

### Sustainability & Climate Modeling

1. **cdr-framework-2025**  
   Link: https://github.com/BleuRadience/cdr-framework-2025  
   Open-source Python model projecting ~85 ± 8 GtCO₂ cumulative removal (2025–2050) via avoided deforestation, active reforestation, and mycelium-hemp bio-composites. Features Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis and visualizations. Strong early adoption: 22+ clones.

2. **ai-water-framework-2025**  
   Hosted on Bleurayn platform  
   Model conserving potable water in AI data centers — projecting ~12 trillion liters saved by 2050 through liquid/immersion cooling, recycled sources, and efficiency pathways. Explosive launch: 31 clones on day one.

### Advanced Materials & Energy Innovation

3. **LENR-YBCO Framework**  
   Conceptual modeling framework exploring Low-Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) integrated with YBCO high-temperature superconductors. Focuses on theoretical pathways and material synergies for potential clean energy breakthroughs.

### Biotech & Clinical Operations Tools

4. **GenoPatternComplete**  
   React prototype for voice-authenticated genetic pattern analysis with EHR integration and ethical bias mitigation — designed for secure adult genomics workflows.

5. **ZeroEDC**  
   Streamlined electronic data capture system optimized for clinical trial speed, compliance, and cost efficiency.

6. **NT360 RealTime Clinical Intelligence**  
   Public prototype with live ClinicalTrials.gov API integration, real-time trial analytics, and embedded regulatory compliance features.

7. **AvaBleu Verify**  
   Employee verification and compliance platform featuring AI assistant, Quest Diagnostics integration, and healthcare risk reduction tools.

### Education Technology

8. **Nexus-EduKids**  
   Educational platform with investor-focused demos, "Money Smart Kids" financial literacy module, and interactive voice engine.

### Communication & Decentralized Tools

9. **BLEUConfer**  
   Decentralized video conferencing prototype using WebRTC and Sovereign Peer ID architecture.

### Creative & Design Prototypes

10. **BLEURenderX PhotoPro**  
    Proprietary AI-enhanced photography and rendering software.

11. **ShoeDesign Pro**  
    Custom footwear design prototype.

12. **Architectural Concept Series**  
    Designs inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright and contemporary Black architects.
